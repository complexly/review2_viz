# Session 2: Visualization @ Tools of Economic Complexity Analysis

The lab session contains an introduction [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1URZammv5GSz4Ox8O_7UEcLpexjRsqYu9) and three parts of materials and exercises in the Google Colab environment:

1. Visualization with network+community: [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fOJy5VK7MKSk0WDCrMCKhXVuh5PIEkXj)  
Alternative choice: visualization with UMAP+clustering: [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TCxyDt2WHRx8TEBolqRFPCGFWlXIFsFk)
2. Visualization with Treemaps: [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gSgO74bBSi8kXpS18ApphGbvekGMKulK)
3. Visualization with maps: [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10OQGFzGh1mQdrv_z7M9-8z8gr3uN0v-p)

For basic visualization with matplotlib/seaborn/bokeh/plotly/etc. in python, you could learn through this [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/charts.ipynb) by yourself.

R user could use this [tutorial](https://github.com/complexly/review3_api313m) and create similar visualizations.
